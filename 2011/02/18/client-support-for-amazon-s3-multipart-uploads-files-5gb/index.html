      <p>I recently had a need to upload a few large (11GB) files to S3 for offsite archive purposes. Amazon announced support for objects &gt;5GB back in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2010/11/10/Amazon-S3-Introducing-Multipart-Upload/" title="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2010/11/10/Amazon-S3-Introducing-Multipart-Upload/">November 2010</a>, so I had assumed that most S3 clients and libraries had support for it already.  I was wrong.  It turns out that in order to support large files, you need to use the new &ldquo;multipart upload&rdquo; feature.  What I found was that many S3 clients do not yet support multipart uploads.</p>

<p>In case this helps save anyone else a few hours of time, here is a summary of what I found regarding multipart upload support in the various S3 clients:</p>

<p>As of Feb 18, 2011:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Multipart uploads supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://s3browser.com/" title="S3 Browser">S3 Browser (FREE and PRO) - Win32</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cloudberrylab.com/" title="CloudBerry Explorer">CloudBerry Explorer (PRO only) - Win32</a></li>
<li><strong>UPDATE</strong> :   <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" title="Cyberduck">Cyberduck 4 - Mac OSX / Win32</a></li>
<li><strong>UPDATE</strong> : <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd" title="s3cmd">s3cmd  - python, multi-platform (version 1.1.0-beta2 +)</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Multipart uploads NOT supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" title="Cyberduck">Cyberduck - Mac OSX</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/" title="Transmit FTP client for Mac">Transmit - Mac OSX</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cloudberrylab.com/" title="CloudBerry">CloudBerry Explorer (FREE version) - Win32</a></li>
<li><a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd" title="s3cmd">s3cmd  - python, multi-platform</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bucketexplorer.com/" title="Bucket Explorer">Bucket Explorer - multi-platform</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>To solve my immediate need I used S3 Browser on Windows 7.  It was the only <em>free</em> client I found that supported multipart uploads.  I mostly use a Mac, however, so if someone knows of a free S3 client for Mac please let me know.</p>

<p>I did not look at which S3 libraries support multipart uploads yet.  I have heard that my favorite python library - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boto/" title="boto aws library">boto</a> - supports it already.  And I have seen some reports that RightScale&rsquo;s <a href="http://rightaws.rubyforge.org/" title="right\_aws">right_aws</a> ruby library may support it on some platforms.  I&rsquo;m not sure about the others.  Post in the comments if you want to confirm support for multipart uploads in your favorite S3 client or library.</p>

<p><strong>Update (3/10/2010):</strong> Cyberduck 4.x was released this week and includes support for multipart uploads and 5TB uploads.  A Windows version is also available now.  Pretty cool, good job Cyberduck.</p>

<p><strong>Update (4/18/2012):</strong> <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd-110b2-released" title="s3cmd 1.1.0-beta2 release announcement">s3cmd 1.1.0-beta2</a> is available and supports multipart uploads along with many other new S3 and Cloudfront features. Grab the beta or wait for 1.1.0 final to be released</p>
