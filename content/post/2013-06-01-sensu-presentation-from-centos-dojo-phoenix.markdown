title: Sensu Presentation from CentOS Dojo Phoenix
url: /2013/06/01/sensu-presentation-from-centos-dojo-phoenix/


---

I was invited to speak at CentOS Dojo in Phoenix, AZ recently (May 2013) about the Sensu monitoring framework. I wanted to do something a little bit different than past presentations and try to show some use cases that fit what Sensu can do rather than just do a basic introduction to Sensu.

<!--more-->

Check out the presentation below. The first half is an overview of Sensu (most of the audience at CentOS Dojo had not heard of Sensu yet) and the second half introduces (whet's the appetite?!) some cool uses of Sensu such as automated cleanup and decommissioning of EC2 nodes, routing checks to different teams in Pagerduty, embedding "playbook" documentation in checks to help speed up MTTR.

Many thanks to [@jeremy\_carroll](https://twitter.com/jeremy_carroll "@jeremy\_carroll") for his feedback and assistance.
