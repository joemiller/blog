On May 26, 2011, [John Vincent](http://lusislog.blogspot.com/ "John Vincent"), aka [@lusis](https://twitter.com/#!/lusis "@lusis"), started a conversation with a simple tweet that led to an hour-plus chat on IRC freenode between some very smart folks.  The IRC channel was supposed to go away after the chat was over but instead it has survived and is attracting more and more attention.

The genesis of it all is the general staleness of the open source monitoring landscape.  There have been numerous and rapid improvements in operations tools in the last 10 years but when it comes to monitoring we're still pretty much stuck on the same tools we've been using since the late-90s.  It would be understandable if these tools were "as good as it gets", but they're not, and there's definitely room for improvement and sharing of ideas and experiences.  If nothing else, at least there's a central place for people to discuss monitoring and share ideas.  There's hardly a day that goes by where someone doesn't stop into ##monitoringsucks on IRC and announce a new tool or concept they're hacking away on.

Since the initial chat, a set of github.com repos has popped up to collect links to various tools and blog posts on the topic of monitoring:

- [irc-logs](https://github.com/monitoringsucks/irc-logs "https://github.com/monitoringsucks/irc-logs") - IRC log of the initial chat that started it all on 5/26/2011 is available here
- [tools-repo](https://github.com/monitoringsucks/tool-repos "https://github.com/monitoringsucks/tool-repos") - a **great** resource for many monitoring tools
- [blog-posts](https://github.com/monitoringsucks/blog-posts "https://github.com/monitoringsucks/blog-posts") - a growing list of interesting monitoring related blog posts

If you're interested in helping make the art of monitoring better, consider stopping by IRC Freenode or contributing to the github repos.  I'm hoping to learn quite a bit out of this little spark that John created.
