title: Alternative skins for Skype 5 and 6 on Mac OSX
url: /2011/05/24/alternative-skins-for-skype-5-on-mac-osx/

The consensus at this point is that Skype 5 on Mac OSX is ugly and wastes a ton of screen space for no good reason (all of this is true, btw.) But, you don't have to live with the ugliness.  It's not widely known, but Skype 5 supports skins or "chatstyles", which are constructed entirely in HTML/CSS/Javascript, so they're easy to write and hack.

Skype's official page for information on ChatStyles:   [http://macthemes.skype.com/start](http://macthemes.skype.com/start "http://macthemes.skype.com/start")

Here are a few of the alternate ChatStyles available on github:

- [PanamericanaMini](http://pongsocket.com/experiments/skype5mini "PanamericanaMini Skype ChatStyle") - this is probably the first alternate ChatStyle.  It's very similar to the default Panamericana theme, but with some whitespace removed.
- [Brief](http://media.miekd.com/brief/ "Brief Skype ChatStyle") - nice theme.  Check out the [screenshots](http://media.miekd.com/brief/#preview "Brief Skype ChatStyle screenshots").
- [My fork of Brief on github](https://github.com/joemiller/Brief "joemiller Brief fork") - I like the Brief chatstyle, but I made some small modifications to further reduce extra whitespace and I modified colors slightly.
- [Simples](http://edds.github.com/Simples.SkypeChatStyle/ "Simples Skype ChatStyle") - heavily influenced by the Renkoo style for Adium.   [Screenshot](https://github.com/edds/Simples.SkypeChatStyle/blob/skype-v5/screenshot.png "Simples screenshot").
- [StyleShift](https://github.com/Simbul/Skype-StyleShift "StyleShift") - reduced whitespace, every image URL is expanded in a linked thumbnail, custom emoticons.

More ChatStyles are available in Skype's [ChatStyle Gallery](http://macthemes.skype.com/gallery "Skype ChatStyles Gallery").  They're also running a competition, so you can go vote for your favorite.
