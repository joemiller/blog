This blog sat idle for 5 years, the last post was 2014. Old posts have been
un-published from the site but are still available in the
github [repo](https://github.com/joemiller/blog/tree/master/content/post).

In addition to retiring old posts the blog was migrated from
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hosting is
now a combination of Github Pages + Cloudflare (previously S3 + Cloudflare).
With [Circle-CI](https://circleci.com) deploying on `master` merges.

There may be a few posts going forward. We'll see. I might just get
bored of it again. Part of the switch from jekyll to hugo was to simplify
the process of managing the site and making it more likely I'll actually
do something on it.
