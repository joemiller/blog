title: Charlie Sheen plugin for the Hudson/Jenkins CI Server
url: /2011/04/26/charlie-sheen-plugin-for-hudson-jenkins/


---

I built a Charlie Sheen "Persona" plugin for our Hudson continuous integration server at work, which is now available on my github page.  If you're familiar with the Chuck Norris plugin, then you know what this is all about.

Add a little bit of Sheen-ius to your Hudson/Jenkins server!!  Tiger blood is included.  #winning
